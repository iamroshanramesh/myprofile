This website contains my personal information attached with my resume. Personal Information represents Photo,mail,location,contact info etc. It's a static web page.  I have programmed the contact form of this site so that the mail is triggered automatically to both user and the admin. This has been made with Local host(XAMPP Server). 


This website has been made with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP.

Server used to trigger mail - Local host(XAMPP)
Other tools used : Apache 2, MySQL.

In order to execute these files with full features, XAMPP needs to be used.

NOTE: Place these files in htdocs folder inside opt/lampp directory.

Thankyou!

Happy Coding ;)
